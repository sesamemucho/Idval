Done: Make Taggers use endpoints. The converters should make more use of
      them. For instance, there should be only one FLAC encoder/decoder,
      that should be specified with three sets of endpoints (WAV:FLAC,
      OGG:FLAC, FLAG:WAV).


The test audio data files, sbeep*.*, should have a special tag value. See GettagsTest.pm for more info.

#rename Providers.pm to ProviderMgr.pm
rename Plugin.pm to Provider.pm

rename Plugins/* to Providers/*

Taggers are Providers
Converters are Providers

Providers are Plugins  , but not in an OO way
Commands are Plugins         ""

Plugins have .pm extensions
Plugins have 'package Idval::Plugin::.....'
The package name is purely for internal record-keeping. A command is put into the package 'Idval::Script'.
Plugins are searched for in each of 'plugin_directories'. No
recursion! An Idval plugin is identified by an extension of '.pm' and
a package name of 'Idval::Plugin::....'. This allows us to use '.pm'
extensions and not be mixed up with regular Perl modules.


Commands are identified (in, say, idv) by the lower-cased file name
The routine in a Command to be executed must be named 'main'
