Done: Make Taggers use endpoints. The converters should make more use of
      them. For instance, there should be only one FLAC encoder/decoder,
      that should be specified with three sets of endpoints (WAV:FLAC,
      OGG:FLAC, FLAG:WAV).


The test audio data files, sbeep*.*, should have a special tag value. See GettagsTest.pm for more info.
