=head1 NAME

Idval - foo on yoo

=head1 Introduction

Idval is a tool for manipulating files that contain metadata, such as
mp3, flac, and other music files; jpeg and other exif image files; and
any other kind of files that contain metadata.

Two of the principles behind Idval are: 1) that the authoritative
source for a media file's metadata is the media file itself, and 2)
metadata should be presented in a form that's easy to handle with a
text editor. 

Keep a music collection in lossless FLAC format, and then convert to
OGG or MP3 as needed for use with portable music players.

The name "Idval" came from "ID Validation". Define rules for a valid
set of ID tags, and Idval will show which tags break the rules. Edit
the text file that represents the metadata and use Idval to correct
the bad tags.

=head2 About the Documentation

This document is the user manual and reference guide. Information of
interest to developers is in XXX.

=head2 Installing Idval

B<Idval>, by itself, knows how to read and write tags for MP3 and JPEG
files. To do anything like what B<Idval> was designed to do, you will
need some more programs. All the programs mentioned here are Free
software.

Get I<Idval> from XXX. Unpack it in a directory of your choosing. You
can try it out there, or install it in the usual way with

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

=head3 Requirements

The only requirement is Perl (L<http://www.perl.org/>), version 5.8 or
later.

=head3 Dependencies

To process FLAC files, you will need the flac toolset
L<http://flac.sourceforge.net/>.

To process OGG files, you will need the Ogg Vorbis toolset L<http://www.vorbis.com/>.

To convert to or from MP3 files, you will need the LAME tool
L<http://lame.sourceforge.net/>.

To convert ABC files, you will need abc2midi
(L<http://abc.sourceforge.net/abcMIDI/>) and the MIDI decoder Timidity
(L<http://timidity.sourceforge.net/>).

None of these are strictly required, although you will want the FLAC
tools and either or both of the OGG and lame tools. B<Idval> will
automatically detect the presence of these tools when it starts, and
will simply disable functionality if a required tool is unavailable.


=head2 Running idv

B<Idval> is a command-line program. It comes with a script that can be
used to invoke the various commands that come with B<Idval>.

    $ idv <ENTER>

will invoke the Idval interpreter, and present the C<idv: >
prompt. Some handy commands are B<help> and B<about>. Perhaps the
first command you will use is one to catalog your existing metadata
files:

   idv: gettags F<directory> F<directory> ... <ENTER>

where the F<directory>s are directories or folders in which you keep
your music, image, or abc files. You can give one or more directory
names here. B<Idval> will look in all the subdirectories under each
F<directory> to find files. Before you quit, be sure to issue a
B<store> command, to save this data for next time. If you don't,
you'll have to enter another B<gettags> command.

   idv: store <ENTER>

When you're done:

   idv: quit <ENTER>

See L</"Built-in commands"> to get information about all of B<Idval's>
commands.
