=head1 NAME

i18n_keynames - A list of key names that can be localized.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Anything that a user is likely to see or enter or use in a
configuration file is localizeable, with some exceptions (see
L<EXCEPTIONS>, below). This includes in particular command names and
configuration keywords. This file contains a should-be-complete list
of these items.

As with the other localizeable text, keynames that do not have a
localized value default to en_us.
