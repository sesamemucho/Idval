Idval - Toolkit for manipulating files with their metadata.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Idval is a tool for manipulating files that contain metadata, such as
mp3, flac, and other music files; jpeg and other exif image files; and
any other kind of files that contain metadata.

Two of the principles behind Idval are: 1) that the authoritative
source for a media file's metadata is the media file itself, and 2)
metadata should be presented in a form that's easy to handle with a
text editor. 

Keep a music collection in lossless FLAC format, and then convert to
OGG or MP3 as needed for use with portable music players.

The name "Idval" came from "ID Validation". Define rules for a valid
set of ID tags, and Idval will show which tags break the rules. Edit
the text file that represents the metadata and use Idval to correct
the bad tags.



Idval works by using "plugins". Idval plugins read metadata from
files, write metadata to files, convert between file formats, and manipulate metadata XXX
