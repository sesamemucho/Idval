* Scenario: permanent derived tree

User has source music, mostly in flac. Has a separate permanent
derived tree in mp3 (aac) for online jukebox (or other player). Wants
to move source or derived files around, without re-coding.

Idv needs to be able to match up files. Possibly a sync operation
could make a cache of this data. Perhaps each file can have an MD5
hash on the contents (flac/ogg encoding does this).

* Scenario: Wacky MP3 player

Some MP3 players have severe restrictions on the names/numbers of
files or directories, for instance, having only 10 single-level
directories. Considering re-coding and transfer (USB 1) time, it may
be desireable to intelligently rename and move files on the device
rather than clear and start over.

Capability in separate, special-purpose scripts? More smarts in sync
(and sync config files)?
